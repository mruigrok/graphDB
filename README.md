# graphDB
graph database

## structure
this project has been split up to four packages as of now. 
1. engine: for graph algorithms/traversal/doing actual query
2. server: this is the interface for users to interact with the database
3. query: this will take in a user query and translate to the actual action needed to do by the engine
4. test: all classes/functions will be unit tested here

## test
for now follow the test class nomenclature. formal docs to come!
