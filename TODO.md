# TODO
things that need to be done

## engine

- find shortest path between two nodes given some relation (relation is optional); return ordered array list of nodes
  - if we do not have weights, a simple BFS finds the shortest path. However, with weights; refer to:
  https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/shortest-path-algorithms/tutorial/

## query

- look into languages vs just api

## server

- finish query functionality


## test

- whenever we create graph functions, create a unit test for it
